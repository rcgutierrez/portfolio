    "In this role, I work to aid the company’s clients, mainly schools and school districts, to get the most out of Edlio’s CMS and their websites. Typically this involves making changes on their homepage using JSP API calls and Javascript for functional updates, and HTML and Sass for cosmetic changes. Additionally, I would add DNS records as well as walk them through the CMS’s modules. This was a very front facing role, so I am in constant contact with customers through phone calls, emails, and support tickets. I have also participated in webinars explaining different aspects of the CMS to clients and have written a technical article on the company’s help center.",
